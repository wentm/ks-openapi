Contribute
==========

MDwiki is an open source effort. All kinds of contributions are always welcome!

Contributing Documentation
------------

The MDwiki website is realized itself with MDwiki. You can just [fork MDwiki on GitHub](http://github.com/Dynalon/mdwiki), modify the `gh-pages` branch and send a pull request. There is no need to submit a CLA whatsoever.

Contributing Sourcecode
--------------

If you are a developer, feel free to [fork MDwiki at GitHub](http://github.com/Dynalon/mdwiki) and send in pull requests. Right now there are no real coding guidelines, but included in the MDwiki source tree is an [.editorrc](http://editorconfig.org/) that you should use and respect.

For code contributions, submission of a contributors license agreement is required. Why? The reason is that MDwiki is licensed GPLv3 but with some linking exceptions: Those exceptions allow you to use non-copyleft code to be linked against MDwiki during runtime (which is required when using Google Maps, Disqus, Twitter and so on). This is only possible because of the additional linking clauses. For future versions of MDwiki, new external sources might require a linking exception and therefore I need to be able to relicense your contribution - hence the requirement for a CLA. This is nothing exceptional, larger projects like [jQuery](http://contribute.jquery.org/CLA/) require you to submit a CLA before contribution, too.

The CLA is using the template text from the [Harmony Project](http://harmonyagreements.org/) and the terms have not been modified.

### Steps for becoming a contributor

1. Select a contributor license agreement and submit the form at the very bottom of the page:

  * [CLA for individuals (private persons)](cla-individual.md)
  * [CLA for entities (companies, bureaus and so on)](cla-entity.md)


2. Open a pull request **after** you submitted the CLA agreement. In the pull request message, explicitly state that you have submitted the agreement so that I can match your GitHub nickname against the submitted data.
3. The pull request is considered for code review and merged into the MDwiki source if everything is ok :)

Note: For future contributions, you can directly open up new pull requests and do **not** need to follow steps 1. and 2.
